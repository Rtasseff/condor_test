    "Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is a concept in Finance that describes ways of diversifying and allocating assets in a financial portfolio in order to maximize the portfolio's expected return given the owner's risk tolerance. American economist Harry Markowitz first introduced MPT in a 1952 paper. The theory was intended to eliminate ideosyncratic risk, which is the risk inherent in a particular investment due to its unique characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** At some point want to stress that mathmatically we ae using volitility as a statistical measure for 'risk', but the use of risk has some implied meaning that is not covered by this analysis. then further expand on what it might mean in a later example ***\n",
    "\n",
    "A key component of this framework is diversification. When using MPT, an investor bundles different types of investments together so that when some of the securities fall in value, other securities rise in equal amount. Thus, the overall portfolio stays even but as markets rise overall, the portfolio rises along with the market's inside tide.\n",
    "\n",
    "MPT argues that any given investment's risk and return characteristics should not be viewed alone but evaluated by how it affects the overall portfolio's risk and return. That is, an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that will result in greater returns without a higher level of risk. As an alternative, starting with a desired level of expected return, the investor can construct a portfolio with the lowest possible risk that is capable of producing that return.\n",
    "\n",
    "MPT uses precise financial mathematics to carefully construct the portfolio. The steps involved included:\n",
    "1. portfolio selection - valuing and choosing the securities that might be included in the portfolio;\n",
    "2. portfolio optimization - calculating the optimal allocation, or percentage, for each of the selected assets (i.e. choosing the right mix of assets to maximize return and/or minimize risk);\n",
    "3. portfolio rebalancing - after the portfolio is implimented (i.e. assets are purchased) the value of individual assets will change over time and the holdings of various assets will need to be decreased or increased to ensure the original allocation (i.e. to maintain the correct overall percentage of each asset); \n",
    "4. portfolio reallocation - periodically it is important to check on the behaviour of individual assets as changes to the asset allocations may needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Went off on a tangent here, need to focus this ***\n",
    "In the analysis here, we focused on step (2). Other steps will be convered in future projects and Condor Funds materials. It is worth pointing out that step (4) is of important practicale concern. Since the analysis here is enterly dependant on historical data, future events may change the statistical estiamtes of this data as they ocurr. In addition, there are many other market factors to consider for investment choices. The importance of these factors depends on the preferences of the individual investor. In particular, the time-frame for investment and the size (number of different assets) of the portfolio impact the liklyhood that observed returns and risks mirror historical ones. Longer investment time-frames and bigger portfolios (e.g. a 'buy-and-hold' straetegy over 10+ years on a well diversifed portfolio) allow for noise and abnormal events to smooth out, or correct themselves, over time. In these cases, reallocation could be done by simply repeating step (2). Shorter time frames (e.g. < 5 years) become increasingly reliant on other market insights not considered here. Of course there is no guarentee on any time-frame, as past performance does not always mean future results. For example, a new technology could drive a once strong company into bankruptcy over the course of a decade. In this case there would be no chance of recovery over time. However, there are stratagies accessible to even novice investors for periodically (sometimes without effort) repeating step (1) as well, but these will not be discussed here. \n",

    "Valuing the securities that might be included in the portfolio.\n",
    "Calculating the desired asset allocation, that is, the mix of assets.\n",
    "Performing calculations to optimize the portfolio to get the maximum amount of return for the minimum amount of risk.\n",
    "Using financial analysis to monitor the portfolio to see if it meets expectations and then making changes to the individual securities or asset mix when market warrant a change.\n",
    "An important consideration in MPT is that based on statistical measures such as variance and correlation, a single investment's performance is less important than how it impacts the entire portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "MPT also assumes that investors are risk-averse, meaning that they prefer a less risky portfolio to a riskier one for a given level of return. As a practical matter, risk aversion implies that most people should invest in multiple asset classes (stocks, bonds, commodities, cash equivalents or cryptocurrencies for example).\n",
