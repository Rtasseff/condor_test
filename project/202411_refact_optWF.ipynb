These projects are meant for testing code and learning concepts in a transparent, and often evolving manner. If new methodologies, stratagies or fundamental understandings are applied in the future, they will most likely be explored in future projects. For transparency and documentation, old projects will not be removed but instead will be deprecated (and clearly marked as such).
