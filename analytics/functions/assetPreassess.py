# This module contains python functions to pre assess risk assets
# based on historical data over multiple years.
#
# It is intended to first gather key meta parameters for statistical analysis:
# - Sampling Frequency 
# - Sample Period 
# And to inform very basic expectations in behaviour 
# - Expectations on abnormal events (and how long they typically last)
# - Expectations on typical returns for long-term holding of the asset
#
# These functions were written specifcally for the Condor Funds Pipeline 
# Updates, supporting functions, other modules and project notebooks:
# https://github.com/Rtasseff/condor_test
#
# There is no warranty or guarantee of any kind
